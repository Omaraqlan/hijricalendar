In their papers the delegates have dealt with the sorry situation caused by divergent practices of Muslim's during the beginnings and endings of the Month of Ramadan and during the religions holidays and feast - days.

Delegates have unanimously agreed on the necessity of tackling with this problem which in fact goes against the principles laid down by the verses of the Holy Kur'an which clearly states: "Surely this community of your in one community" Thus, the muslims are not permitted to follow divergent paths in religious matters. In the following verse God, the most High, command solidarity and unity: "And hold you fast to God's bond, together, and do not scatter".

In the conference two committees of inquiry were established: Committee of Religion;Committee of Astronomers. In each committee the specialists worked on the papers that came under their specializations. After a detailed and comprehensive discussion, the Conference unanimously accepted the following resolutions.

  * What is basic is to see the moon; whether it is seen simply by naked human eye, or, through modern astronomical obseryatjons makes no difference whatsoever.
  * So as to take the astronomers' account into consed eration from a religion point of view, they ought to base their astronomical observations upon the fact that the moon could be mm in the horizon by human eye after the sun - set And after the elimination all the obstacles which hinder the visibility of the moon. This is called "Visibility by iudgment (Hükmiru'yet)
  * For the visibility of the moon, there are two basic conditions which have to be fulfilled:
  1. After "conjuction", the angular distance 'between the moon and the sun should not be less than 8 degrees. As it is known, the visibility of the moon starts between 7 and 8 degrees; but for the sake of precaution, taking 8.degree as essantial is accepted unanimously.
  1. The angular distance of the moon from the horizon should not be less than 5 degrees.Only under this condition does it become possible to see the crescent by naked human eye in, the normal conditions,

  * For the visibility of the moon no special place is
required. When such visibility becomes possible in any part of
the earth, it will be legitimate to conculede that the lunar
month Has started. In order to acheive the unity and solidarity
of Islamic world in this respect the visibility of the moon
should be declared by the observatory which is to be established
in Macca. According to the Common Lunar Calender mentioned in the next article.
  * Religious Scholars, astronomers and the authorities
in the observatory should prepare a calender for each year, by
basing themselves on the critaria stated in the articles 2, 3 and
  * The committee of Calender will hold a meeting every year so
as to approve the Common Calender . The first meeting will
take place in Rabiu'l ahir 1399/March 1979 in Istanbul.
  * The comittee of calender consists of the represent
atives of following countries:
Bangladesh, Algeria, Indonesia, Iraq, Katar, Kuwait, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia arid Turkey. In order to hold a meeting, it is not necessary to bring together all the repsent-atives.
  * Again the above-mentioned committe will prepare maps in accordance with the critaria stated above, showing the places where the cresrent is visible in the months of Ramadan, Shawwal and Zilhicce. This will make things easier for those who, wish to see the crescent by simple observations and to be satisfied with the reckoning of the Calender Committee. Such maps will also help those states which want to carry out astronomical observations through their efficient and reliable authorities and organizations.
  * These resolutions and recommendations will be forwarded to the Secretary General of the Islamic foreign Minis-fdi' Conference, and in their first meeting, which will take place in Rabat, the foreign ministers will be called upon to recognize and to put into practice the above mentioned reseletions.
